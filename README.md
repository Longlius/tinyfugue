tinyfugue on github
===================

This is a (mostly identical) copy of the TinyFugue 5.0b8 source tree
hosted in a Github repo. The original can be found at:

tinyfugue.sourceforge.net


Mostly identical...?
====================

Vanilla 5.0b8 cannot be built using newer versions of PCRE. A patch
to fix this has been applied to the code in this repo.


Why?
====

TinyFugue is my favorite MUD client and I want to experiment with the
code. This repo is meant for forking, backup, etc. The actual code is
unlikely to be modified.
